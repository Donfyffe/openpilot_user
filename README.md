This allows Kisapilot users to store their custom parameters settings online.
Similar to Kisapilot Presets, but the saved parameters are store online instead of on the device.
So when you have to do a clean install of Kisapilot, your parameters settings can be easily restored.
You could save multiple presets for different driving profiles.
You could create a highway and a local road driving profile or a shared car driver profile. 
Great convenience for the Kisapilot testers.
